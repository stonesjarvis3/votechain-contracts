Soroban smart contracts for **VoteChain** — decentralized on-chain governance and voting on the Stellar blockchain.

VoteChain enables DAOs, protocols, and communities to create proposals, cast token-weighted votes, enforce quorum, and execute decisions — all transparently on-chain with an immutable audit trail.

---

## Features

- **Proposals** — create governance proposals with title, description, quorum, and voting duration
- **Token-weighted voting** — vote weight equals the voter's governance token balance
- **Yes / No / Abstain** — three-way vote with quorum and majority enforcement
- **Double-vote prevention** — each address can vote exactly once per proposal
- **Lifecycle management** — Active → Passed/Rejected → Executed, or Cancelled by admin
- **On-chain events** — every action emits a verifiable event for off-chain indexers

## Governance Contract Reference

| Function | Caller | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize(admin, voting_token)` | Admin | Set admin and governance token |
| `create_proposal(proposer, title, description, quorum, duration)` | Anyone | Create a new proposal |
| `cast_vote(voter, proposal_id, vote)` | Token holder | Cast Yes/No/Abstain vote |
| `finalise(proposal_id)` | Anyone | Finalise after voting period ends |
| `execute(admin, proposal_id)` | Admin | Mark a passed proposal as executed |
| `cancel(admin, proposal_id)` | Admin | Cancel an active proposal |
| `get_proposal(proposal_id)` | Anyone | Read proposal state |
| `has_voted(proposal_id, voter)` | Anyone | Check if address has voted |
| `proposal_count()` | Anyone | Total proposals created |

### Proposal Lifecycle

```
Active → Passed   → Executed
       → Rejected
       → Cancelled
```

### Pass Conditions

```
total_votes >= quorum  AND  votes_yes > votes_no
```

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Blockchain | Stellar (Soroban) |
| Language | Rust |
| SDK | Soroban SDK v22.0.0 |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |

## Environment Configuration

Config files live in `config/` — one per environment:

| File | Environment |
|---|---|
| `config/local.toml` | Local Stellar node (default) |
| `config/testnet.toml` | Stellar Testnet |
| `config/mainnet.toml` | Stellar Mainnet (no real values committed) |

Each file contains the RPC URL, network passphrase, and deployed contract addresses.

**Switching environments** — set the `NETWORK` variable before running deploy scripts:

```bash
# Local (default)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Testnet
NETWORK=testnet ./scripts/deploy.sh

# Mainnet — fill in contract addresses in config/mainnet.toml first
NETWORK=mainnet ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

> **Security**: `config/mainnet.toml` is committed with placeholder values only.  
> Never commit real contract addresses or private keys.

## API Documentation

The governance contract interface is described in [`api/openapi.yml`](api/openapi.yml).

Open [`docs/api/index.html`](docs/api/index.html) in a browser for interactive Swagger UI docs, or serve them locally:

```bash
make docs-serve   # serves on http://localhost:8080
```

Validate the spec against the OpenAPI 3.1 standard:

```bash
make openapi-validate
```
