# SEC-006: Admin Key Rotation Procedure

**Status:** Implemented  
**Priority:** High  
**Affects:** `GovernanceContract` — `propose_admin_transfer`, `accept_admin_transfer`

---

## Overview

Admin key rotation uses a **two-step, time-locked** procedure to prevent accidental or
malicious instant takeover. The current admin nominates a successor; the nominee must
explicitly accept within a configurable window before the key is transferred.

---

## Functions

### `propose_admin_transfer(admin, new_admin, window_secs)`

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `admin` | Current admin address (must authorise the call) |
| `new_admin` | Address being nominated as the next admin |
| `window_secs` | Acceptance window in seconds (0 = default 48 h) |

- Requires `admin.require_auth()`.
- Stores `new_admin` as `PendingAdmin` and records `now + window_secs` as `AdminTransferExpiry`.
- Emits `admprop` event: `(admin, new_admin, expiry)`.
- Calling again replaces any existing nomination.
- The current admin retains all privileges until `accept_admin_transfer` succeeds.

### `accept_admin_transfer(new_admin)`

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `new_admin` | The nominated address accepting the role |

- Requires `new_admin.require_auth()`.
- Reverts with `PendingAdminNotSet` (31) if no nomination exists.
- Reverts with `NotPendingAdmin` (33) if caller is not the nominated address.
- Reverts with `AdminTransferExpired` (32) if `now > expiry`; also clears the stale nomination.
- On success: promotes `new_admin` to admin, clears pending state, emits `admxfer` event.

## Rotation Procedure

```
1. Current admin calls propose_admin_transfer(admin, new_admin, window_secs)
   → admprop event emitted; PendingAdmin stored

2. New admin verifies the nomination on-chain (read PendingAdmin storage)

3. New admin calls accept_admin_transfer(new_admin) within the window
   → admxfer event emitted; new_admin is now admin

4. Old admin has no further privileges
```

## Security Properties

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| Auth required | Both steps require `require_auth()` — no unsigned rotation |
| Time-lock | Nominee must act within the window; expired nominations are auto-cleared |
| No instant takeover | Admin key is not transferred until the nominee explicitly accepts |
| Re-proposal | Admin can replace a pending nomination at any time before acceptance |
| Paused contract | Both functions revert if the contract is paused |
| Zero-address guard | Both addresses are validated against the Stellar zero address |

---

## Error Codes

| Code | Variant | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| 31 | `PendingAdminNotSet` | No pending nomination exists |
| 32 | `AdminTransferExpired` | Acceptance window has passed |
| 33 | `NotPendingAdmin` | Caller is not the nominated address |

---

## Events

| Symbol | Topics | Data |
|--------|--------|------|
| `admprop` | `("admprop",)` | `(current_admin, nominee, expiry: u64)` |
| `admxfer` | `("admxfer",)` | `(old_admin, new_admin)` |

---

## Recommendations

- Use a **48-hour window** (default) for production rotations to allow time for
  verification before the old key is decommissioned.
- After a successful rotation, **revoke or archive** the old admin key material.
- Monitor for `admprop` events on-chain to detect unexpected rotation attempts.
