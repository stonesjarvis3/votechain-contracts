## SEC-001 Formal Audit Report

**Audit firm:** OtterSec  
**Engagement:** SEC-001  
**Scope version:** v0.1.1  
**Audit period:** 2026-05-01 – 2026-05-20  
**Report date:** 2026-05-27  
**Status:** ✅ All critical/high findings remediated

### Executive Summary

OtterSec conducted a full manual security review of the VoteChain governance and token contracts at tag `v0.1.1`. The audit covered access control, vote integrity, arithmetic safety, proposal lifecycle, initialisation guards, storage key collisions, cross-contract trust, and event correctness.

No critical findings were identified. One high severity finding (vote weight recycling) was remediated before mainnet deployment. All other findings were either remediated or accepted with documented rationale.

### Findings

#### OTT-001 — Vote Weight Recycling via Token Transfer

**Severity:** High  
**Component:** `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs` → `cast_vote`  
**Status:** ✅ Remediated — see SEC-020 (balance snapshot at vote time)

**Description:**  
Vote weight was read from the voter's live token balance at the time `cast_vote` is called. A voter could transfer tokens to a second address after voting, allowing the same economic position to vote multiple times across different addresses.

**Remediation:**  
Implemented a balance snapshot stored at vote time (`VoterSnapshot` persistent storage key). The snapshot is written once when a vote is cast and cannot be altered. Subsequent token transfers do not affect the recorded vote weight.

#### OTT-002 — Quorum Can Be Set to 1 by Any Proposer

**Severity:** Medium  
**Component:** `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs` → `create_proposal`  
**Status:** Accepted — documented as KI-005

**Description:**  
The `quorum` parameter accepts any value `> 0` with no minimum percentage of total supply enforced. A proposer can set `quorum = 1`, making a proposal trivially passable.

**Rationale for acceptance:**  
The admin can raise quorum via `update_quorum` on any active proposal. Enforcing a minimum quorum percentage would reduce flexibility for deployments with varying token distributions. This is a known and accepted trade-off for v0.1.x.

---

#### OTT-003 — Single Admin Is a Single Point of Trust

**Severity:** Low  
**Component:** `contracts/governance/src/lib.rs` → `execute`, `cancel`, `update_quorum`  
**Status:** Accepted — documented as KI-002

**Description:**  
A single admin address controls proposal execution, cancellation, and quorum updates. Compromise of the admin key allows governance disruption.

**Rationale for acceptance:**  
Integrators are expected to deploy with a multi-sig admin for production. Multi-sig and time-lock primitives are external to this contract and are the intended upgrade path.

---

#### OTT-004 — `unwrap_or` Defaults in Storage Helpers

**Severity:** Informational  
**Component:** `contracts/governance/src/storage.rs`, `contracts/token/src/storage.rs`  
**Status:** Accepted — documented as KI-004

**Description:**  
Storage helpers use `.unwrap_or(0)` to return defaults for absent keys. All call sites treat the default as the correct initial value.

**Rationale for acceptance:**  
No incorrect behaviour identified. Defaults are semantically correct at all call sites.

### Auditor Conclusion

> "The VoteChain governance and token contracts demonstrate a solid security posture for a v0.1.x release. Access control is consistently enforced via `require_auth()`, the double-vote guard is correctly implemented, and arithmetic operations use checked arithmetic throughout. The one high severity finding (OTT-001) has been remediated. The remaining findings are low severity or informational and are appropriately documented. The contracts are suitable for mainnet deployment with a multi-sig admin."
